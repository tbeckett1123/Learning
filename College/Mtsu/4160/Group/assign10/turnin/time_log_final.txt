Report#1 Summary of Team's efforts thus far										
"The team seems to work rather well together. Upon looking at our class, work, and life schedules we have decided"										
"that the coder and documenter for this segment will be To,, the debugger and tester will be Rodney, and I will be the team leader."										
We all decided that we would use e-mail as a primary form of communication and we would meet as frequently as needed.										
We will meet in the KOM most of the time and the library is our backup meeting place.										
Rodney e-mailed both of the other team members so we all had access to each others email address.										
We met and gave our her our input as to where we all saw the project going so far.										
We left with good feelings towards the group and hope that things will all work out with timing.

Report#3 Summary of Team's efforts thus far				
"After class the group decided that we needed to re-thing our design. Tim was using a string, which Dr. Cripps mentioned would be a bad"				
thing down the road. So off we went from square one again.

Report#Final Summary of Team's efforts thus far				
"We had a lot of finish work down to the last hour, Rodney did a great job of finding bugs and although Tim"				
"was about wore out, he came thru at the end. I actually erased the finished timelog and had to start over from "				
scratch. That explains the extra time for me to complete the project. I hope our product meets the needs as		
well as impresses you. :)
